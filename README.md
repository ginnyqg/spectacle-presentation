# spectacle-presentation

This folder contains a [presentation](https://github.com/ginnyqg/spectacle-presentation/blob/master/my-presentation/src/presentation.js) I did for Columbia's Storytelling class. It uses Spectacle and is written in js. The pdf export is available [here](https://github.com/ginnyqg/spectacle-presentation/blob/master/my-presentation/Spectacle_5800.pdf).
